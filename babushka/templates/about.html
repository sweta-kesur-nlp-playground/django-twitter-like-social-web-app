                                    The babushka doll, also known as a matryoshka or Russian nesting doll, is a traditional Russian toy first made over 100 years ago. The doll has come to symbolise Russian folk culture, as well as the
                                    complex and beautiful layers of women. Babushka dolls are made of wood and painted in bright colours and patterns.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Each babushka is comprised of many round dolls, each a little smaller than the last. They separate at the middle so that each doll can be placed inside the one before it. There are some babushka dolls
                                    with as many as fifty dolls nested inside.

                                <p>This is the story of one very special babushka doll and her five bodies.</p>
                                <p>
                                    There was the outermost body, <strong>Antonia.</strong> She was pure beauty and everyone who saw her raved about her good looks. Beneath that body of beauty hid the second body,
                                    <strong>Loretta,</strong> who was richly adorned. She wore gold ornaments, and her robe was decorated with many different gems that glittered like the ocean on a sunny day. Hidden within the rich body was
                                    <strong> Paula</strong> the body that held all the talents. Whatever Paula did, she was sure to succeed. She knew how to work and always did so with joy and determination. Under the shell of the talented
                                    body was <strong>Viola</strong>, the body of wisdom. Viola knew a lot about the world and learned very quickly. She was always full of brilliant ideas and had clever solutions for every problem. The last
                                    body, the innermost and smallest of all, was <strong>Mary</strong>, the embodiment of love. Mary had a compassionate heart and was very helpful. She had the special ability to dry tears and mend broken
                                    hearts.
                                </p>
                                <p>One day Babushka decides she wants to find out the meaning of life, so she sends her bodies out of the forest and into the world to search for answers.</p>
